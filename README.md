# 251128_BlockBrush

BlockBrush is an early-stage project focused on building a block-based painting and level-building toolkit; this repository will house prototypes, tools, and documentation as the project grows.

## Features
- Planned: block painting and erasing with adjustable brush sizes
- Planned: color palette management for voxel fills
- Planned: import/export flows for sharing builds
- Planned: lightweight UI for quick iteration and testing

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ekimroyrp/251128_BlockBrush.git`
2. Navigate into the project: `cd 251128_BlockBrush`
3. Setup steps will be documented here once the first prototype is ready.

## Controls
Controls will be documented alongside the first interactive build; expect standard camera movement and brush hotkeys to be listed here.
